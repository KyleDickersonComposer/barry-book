# Contributing to The Barry Book

This guide explains how to contribute to The Barry Book, whether you're a jazz educator, musician, or someone interested in preserving Barry Harris's pedagogical tradition.

## What Is This Project?

The Barry Book is built using text files written in LaTeX and LilyPond. Instead of using word processors or design software, we write everything in plain text files that contain special instructions. The computer processes these files to create the final PDF book.

### Why Text Files?

- Easy to track changes and see what was modified
- Multiple people can work on different parts simultaneously
- Complete history of all changes is preserved
- Works well with version control (Git/GitHub)

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Text Editing

Fix typos, improve clarity, or correct errors in the educational content.

Examples:

- Fixing spelling or grammar mistakes
- Improving explanatory text
- Correcting factual errors
- Refining wording to better convey concepts

### 2. Text Writing

Add exercises, explanations, or educational content based on your understanding of Barry Harris's methods.

Examples:

- Adding exercises that illustrate concepts
- Writing explanatory text
- Creating scale maps or harmonic analysis
- Contributing pedagogical content

### 3. LilyPond Contributions

Work with the music notation files (`.lytex` files) to add or correct musical notation.

Examples:

- Adding or correcting musical notation
- Fixing chord symbols or progressions
- Adjusting formatting or layout
- Adding new tunes or exercises

## Getting Started with LilyPond
