# Barry Book Restructure Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Implementation Plan Created
Created `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with a comprehensive plan based on your Trello board structure, including:
- Analysis of all four Trello columns (Structure, Links, Concepts, Little Things)
- Complete tune list extraction
- Proposed LaTeX structure
- File organization plan

### 2. Main LaTeX File Restructured
Created `main.lytex` that replaces the "Modern Practice" content with Barry Harris concepts organized as follows:

#### Part I: Foundations
- **Chapter 1**: Project Overview and Barry Harris (Overview, Teaching Philosophy)
- **Chapter 2**: Essential Tools (Identifying Chords, Functional Harmony, Common Progressions, Changes and Pedal Harmonies)
- **Chapter 3**: The Little Things (Half Step Rules, Thirds, Chord, Half Step Below, Pivot, Important Arpeggio, Surrounding Notes)

#### Part II: Linear Concepts
- **Chapter 4**: Scales for Linear Improvisation (Scale Map Concept, Scale Maps, Practice Methods)
- **Chapter 5**: A Rhythmic Language (Jazz Syncopation, Swing Feel, Rhythm Games)
- **Chapter 6**: Spicing Up the Dominant (Variations, Tritone Substitutions, Advanced Techniques)

#### Part III: Harmonic Concepts
- **Chapter 7**: Scales for Comping (Comping Scales, Voicing Techniques, Rhythm in Comping)
- **Chapter 8**: Change Maps (Understanding Progressions, Creating Maps, Applying Maps)

#### Part IV: Applications
- **Chapter 9**: Tune Analysis Structure (explains the per-tune format)
- **Chapters 10-24**: Individual tune analyses for all 15 tunes from your Trello board:
  1. Blues
  2. Rhythm
  3. Autumn Leaves
  4. How High the Moon
  5. But Not For Me
  6. What Is This Thing Called Love?
  7. Love For Sale
  8. Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise
  9. I Can't Give You Anything But Love
  10. A Night In Tunisia
  11. On Green Dolphin Street
  12. Stella By Starlight
  13. All the Things You Are
  14. Cherokee
  15. 'Round Midnight

Each tune chapter includes 5 sections:
- Tune with Changes
- Scale Map
- Exemplar Solo
- Change Map
- Exemplar Comping

### 3. Directory Structure Created
Created directories for:
- `chapters/` - For all concept chapters
- `tunes/` - For all tune analyses
- `appendix/` - For reference material

## Next Steps

1. **Create Content Files**: You'll need to create the actual `.lytex` files referenced in `main.lytex`. I can create placeholder files if needed.

2. **Add Content**: Populate each section with actual Barry Harris content, exercises, and musical examples.

3. **Create LilyPond Files**: For each tune, create the actual LilyPond notation files for changes, solos, and comping examples.

4. **Update Bibliography**: Add Barry Harris references and any links from your Trello board.

5. **Test Compilation**: Once you have some content, test that the LaTeX compiles correctly.

## Key Changes from Original

- Removed "Modern Practice" part entirely
- Removed "Classical Tools in Jazz Context" part (kept only Barry Harris concepts)
- Removed "Not a Jazz Theory" part structure (concepts reorganized)
- Removed "System Update" part
- Added comprehensive tune analysis section
- Reorganized all concepts to match Trello board structure
- Changed title from "Contemporary Jazz Piano" to "The Barry Book"

The structure now directly reflects your Trello board organization, making it easy to track progress and ensure all planned content is included.
